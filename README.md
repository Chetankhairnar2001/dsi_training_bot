AI camp needs a scalable way to train a large number of instructors in a short period of time with a lean leadership team. Additionally, the current training program doesn’t do a great job of teaching instructors the technologies that they’ll need and doesn’t have enough emphasis on ways to engage students or deal with students who are shy or quiet.

The end product will be a bot that uses LLMs and Langchain to ingest our training documentation and is able to answer questions asked by instructors. The bot should be developed enough that an instructor can ask a question they have to the bot regarding an issue and the bot returns an answer.
